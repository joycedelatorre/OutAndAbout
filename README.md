## Using: HTML/CSS/bootstrap, javascript, jquery

### Goal: The goal of this project is to allow users to be able to list events in a particular city at a specific date and list all the garages that are available in that city and eventually reserve that specific event and garage. 
### Steps:
1. User inputs a city and a date to list all the events.
2. When all the events are listed, the user can add that event to his cart 
and reserve a specified number of tickets.
3. After that the user can list all the garages available in that city and 
can specify the number of spots the user would want to reserve.
4. In order to place an order, the user has to enter their personal 
information as well as credit card information.
5. When the user clicks place order the data will be saved in firebase and 
the user will be given a pdf confirmation page that the user can eventually 
show for admission.
